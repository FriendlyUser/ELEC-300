<em>op amps</em>, are an amplifier abstraction; that is, we can use it without knowing about its insides.</p>

<p>Figure 5.1:&nbsp;Basic Op Amp</p>



</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Above is a <em>single-supply</em> op amp, that can output voltages between 0 and 12 volts, with respect to ground.
<em>Dual-supply</em> op amps are also common; in that case, you’d replace the ground above with -12 volts, and have the
ground (which is then not directly connected to the op amp) where the two rails “meet”, i.e. output range is from 12 volts
above ground all the way down to 12 volts below ground.<br />
That way, the op amp can output negative voltages (again with respect to the circuit ground), which is often required when
dealing with signals such as audio, which are ground referenced and symmetric around the 0 volt axis.<br />
</p>


<p>The ideal op amp has infinite input impedance, and zero output impedance. Thus, no current flows into the input
terminals; all current from the output terminal comes from the power terminals.</p>


<p>In many cases, we don’t really care about showing the supply connection explicitly, and instead use the following
symbol:<br />

<p>This document will use the latter symbol from now on.<br />
</p>


<p>Op amps use a <em>differential</em> input. That is to say, neither of the two input connections is necessarily ground,
and the amplifier amplifies the <em>difference</em> between the two input ports. That is, ideally,</p>


<p>\[ v_o = A (v_+ - v_-) \]</p>


<p>where \(A\) is the amplifier’s voltage gain. In the ideal op amp model, \(A \to \infty \). In real op amps, A is often on
the order of 100,000 or more. Needless to say, most of the time, we don’t want to amplify a signal that much - even a input
voltage difference as tiny as \(12 \mu \)V would be enough to drive the output to the maximum 12 V (\(12 \mu V \cdot
10^6 = 12 V\)) for an amplifier with \(A = 10^6\), which most certainly exist on the market.<br />
</p>


<p>So, to summarize what we’ve seen so far:    </p>


<ul style="list-style-type:none">

<li>
<p>1. The op amp is a <em>differential</em> amplifier ...</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>2. ... that outputs a ground-referenced voltage.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>3. Its gain is extremely high (ideally infinite), often on the order of \(10000\) to a million, or even higher. If we want
less gain, we’ll have to take care of that outside the abstract “amplifier box” that is the op amp.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>4. Op amps can be powered by a single supply (a positive voltage and ground) or a dual supply (a positive and a
negative voltage, with ground being in between the two). There are op amps made specifically for either of these two,
though many works in either configuration.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>To analyze circuits with ideal op amps, we model them as a VCVS, that is, a voltage-controlled voltage source. Again,
no current flows into the input terminals, so we model them as open circuits.<br />

</figure>

<p>Since real-life op amps are powered by a power supply (rather than being ideal sources themselves), they can never
output a voltage that is higher than that of the power supply. Thus, when the difference between the inputs is greater than
\(\displaystyle \frac {\text {Power supply voltage}}{\text {Gain}}\), the op amp <em>saturates</em>, and the output
stays close to the power supply rail.<br />
Here’s a plot of an op amp’s transfer function, with a gain of \(10^6\):</p>


<p>Note the extreme difference in scale between the axes: the \(v_i\) axis is in microvolts, while the \(v_o\) axis is in
volts. The op amp behaves linearly as long as the gain multiplied by the input voltage difference is less than the power
supply voltage (we call this the <em>active region</em>, or sometimes the linear region), but <em>saturates</em> whenever
the voltage difference is greater.<br />
</p>


<p>Most op amps can’t bring the output very close to either power supply rail; an op amp powered by a \(\pm 12\) V
supply can usually swing between roughly -11 and +11 volts, or thereabouts. Therefore, an op amp will generally saturate
before it the power supply voltage. Op amps which can output very close (usually within a few millivolts) of the power rails
are called <em>rail-to-rail output</em> op amps. There are also <em>rail-to-rail input</em> and <em>rail-to-rail
input/output</em> (RRIO) op amps.</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-106"> Noninverting amplifier</span><a id="autopage-106"></a> Let’s use an op
amp to build a noninverting amplifier, one of the simpler (and perhaps more common) uses of an op amp. This
configuration uses a resistive divider between the output and the \(v_-\) terminal to limit the gain to more usable values.
This also has the huge advantage of making the op amp very stable, as opposed to its “raw” form, where the gain \(A\) can
vary extremely much for pretty much no discernable reason.<br />
It looks something like this:<br />

</p>


<p>As always, \(v_o\) is ground-referenced, though that will not be shown explicitly here or in future circuit diagrams.<br
/>
Let’s analyze this circuit. First, we know that the op amp input/output relation is, always,</p>


<p>\[ v_o = A(v_+ - v_-) \]</p>


<p>Let’s find the values of \(v_+\) and \(v_-\) for this circuit.<br />
\(v_+\) is simply our input voltage \(v_I\).<br />
\(v_-\) is given by a simple voltage divider between \(v_o\) and ground, so</p>


<p>\[ v_- = v_o \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]</p>


<p>(Remember that \(v_-\) is an open circuit; the input impedance is infinite, and the connection there doesn’t affect the
voltage divider ratio.)<br />
</p>


<p>Let’s substitute these values back into the first equation, and get:</p>


<p>\[ v_o = A(v_I - v_o \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2}) \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = Av_I - A v_o \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]</p>


<p>We have \(v_o\) terms on both sides; let’s collect all \(v_o\) terms on the left-hand side:</p>


<p>\[ v_o + A v_o \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = A v_I \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o(1 + A \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2}) = A v_I \]</p>


<p>Now we can simply divide both sides by the expression multiplying \(v_o\) and we’re pretty much done:</p>


<p>\[ v_o = \frac {A v_I}{1 + A \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2}} \]</p>


<p>Note that if \(\displaystyle A \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \gg 1\), we can ignore the \(1\) term without losing
any noteworthy amount of precision. For example, if \(A = 10^6\), \(R_1 = 3000\) and \(R_2 = 1000\), which gives a
gain of 3.999984, the value we get using the approximation (ignoring the \(1\)) is exactly \(4\). Such tiny errors don’t
really matter to us, so we can say that</p>


<p>\[ v_o \approx \frac {A v_I}{A \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2}} \]</p>


<p>Note that we can now cancel out the \(A\) terms!</p>


<p>\[ v_o \approx \frac {v_I}{\frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2}} = v_I \cdot \frac {R_1 + R_2}{R_2} \]</p>


<p>Therefore, this configuration gives a voltage gain of almost exactly \(\displaystyle \frac {R_1 + R_2}{R_2} = 1 +
\frac {R_1}{R_2}\), as long as we make sure that \(\displaystyle A \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \gg 1\) is true, by
making sure we never make \(R_1\) much, much bigger than \(R_2\). However, even when \(R_1\) is <em>1000
times</em> greater than \(R_2\), the approximation works out quite well: for \(A = 10^6\), \(R_1 = 10^6\) \(\Omega \)
and \(R_2 = 1000\) \(\Omega \) the error is about 0.1%. Such a configuration would give a gain of roughly 1000.<br />
</p>


<p>So, this circuit works! It gives as a gain we can set via simple resistor values, and thus the op amp gain \(A\) is
virtually irrelevant to this circuit, as long as it’s very large.<br />
The question is, though, <em>how</em> does it work? The answer is that the resistor divider connected to the inverting
input creates a <em>negative feedback</em> loop.</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-109"> Negative feedback</span><a id="autopage-109"></a> Negative feedback is a
quite simple concept. This explanation may be a bit confusing at first, but think it through carefully and you should get it
- and when you do, you’ll agree that it’s simple! I’ll copy the schematic from above for convenience:<br />

<p>Figure 5.5:&nbsp;Negative feedback Op Amp</p>



</figcaption>

</figure>

<p><br />
</p>


<p>Let’s think about how this circuit works. Say \(v_I\) is a static value of 5 volts, and \(R_1 = R_2\) (in which case
their actual values won’t matter). The node voltage \(v_-\) will be exactly half of \(v_o\). \(v_o\), in turn, will be
(according to the gain equation we found) \(\displaystyle v_I \cdot \frac {R + R}{R} = 2\cdot v_I\).<br />
So, to begin with, we have</p>


<p>\[ v_I = v_+ = 5 V \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = 2\cdot v_I = 10 V \]</p>


<p>\[ v_- = \frac {v_o}{2} = 5 V \]</p>


<p>... Well, \(v_+ \neq v_-\), but they’re very, very close to equal. If they were exactly equal, \(v_o\) would be the gain
times 0 (\(A(v_+ - v_-) = 10^6(5 - 5) = 0\)), which clearly isn’t the case here. The difference depends on the op amp’s
gain \(A\), but will be on the order of microvolts for a gain of \(10^6\). For now, we’ll consider them equal, to drive home
the point of negative feedback. In reality, \(v_o\) is just ever so slightly different than \(2 \cdot v_I\).<br />
</p>


<p>So, right now, \(v_+ = v_- = 5 V\), and \(v_o = 10 V\). Now, let’s think about what would happen if, for whatever
reason (op amp instability, external noise, etc.) the voltage at node \(v_o\) suddenly increased to, say, 12 volts, without a
change in the input.<br />
Clearly, the voltage \(v_+\) would remain unchanged; it will always stay at 5 volts due to the voltage source being directly
connected there.<br />
\(v_-\), on the other hand, is half of \(v_o\), and so that node would become \(6\) volts.<br />
So now, after this output voltage bump, we have \(v_+ = 5\), \(v_- = 6\) and \(v_o = 12\). What happens then?<br />
</p>


<p>Well, again, we have the op amp equation: \(v_o = A(v_+ - v_-) = A(5 - 6) = -A\). In words, the op amp would try,
as best it could, to drive the voltage \(v_o\) down to \(-10^6\) volts (using the gain \(A=10^6\) we’ve been using so far).
Needless to say it couldn’t, due to the limited power supply, but it would try really hard to bring the voltage at the output
node down.<br />
Let’s say it managed to drive the output down to 8 volts in a short time period. At that point, \(v_+ = 5V\),
\(\displaystyle v_- = \frac {8}{2} = 4V\), which means the op amp would try to drive the output <em>up</em> really
hard, since \(v_+ &gt; v_-\), and so on.<br />
In practice, the output wouldn’t fluctuate this much; rather, the reaction would be fast enough that the change virtually
doesn’t happen in the first place. This <em>can</em> certainly lead to unwanted oscillations, but that topic is a bit too
advanced for this section and chapter.<br />
</p>


<p>The important point here is that the negative feedback loop causes the op amp to do whatever it can on the output to
keep the two inputs very close to each other. If the output rises too high, causing \(v_-\) to increase above \(v_+\), it
tries to reduce the output voltage to compensate. If the output drops too low, causing \(v_-\) to drop below \(v_+\), it
tries to increase the output voltage to compensate.<br />
This is a <em>negative feedback loop</em>, a concept which can be applied to many situations, including many not in
electronics.</p>


<p>In negative feedback, a gap between the output and expected output will be used to <em>reduce</em> this gap, and bring
the output closer to the expected value. Therefore negative feedback helps the system become stable.<br />
</p>


<p>Positive feedback is, as one might expect, the opposite. With positive feedback, a small gap between the expected and
actual values will be used to create an even bigger gap, which in turn will increase the amount of feedback, and make the
gap larger yet, etc. A common example is when a microphone picks up sound from a nearby speaker, causing the sound
from the microphone to be sent to the speaker, which leads to more sound being picked up by the microphone, increasing
the volume in a loop until only an extremely loud noise remains.</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-112"> Virtual short/virtual ground</span><a id="autopage-112"></a></p>


<p>When we have an op amp with negative feedback (and <em>only</em> when we have negative feedback!), the feedback
causes \(v_-\) to be almost equal to \(v_+\). We can show this by rearranging the gain equation:</p>


<p>\[ v_o = A(v_+ - v_-) \]</p>


<p>\[ v_+ - v_- = \frac {v_o}{A} \]</p>


<p>If we have a typical op amp with a very high gain, let’s continue assuming \(10^6\), this means that for \(v_o\) in the
typical range of \(\pm 20V\) or less, the difference between \(v_+\) and \(v_-\) will never be larger than on the order of
\(\displaystyle \frac {20V}{10^6} = 20 \mu V\).<br />
Since a short circuit means a zero (or, with wires that have resistances, just a very small) voltage difference, this is referred
to as a <em>virtual short</em>, or (especially when \(v_+\) is tied to ground) as a <em>virtual ground</em>.</p>


<p>This leads to us having three useful constraints when dealing with op amp circuits with negative feedback:</p>


<p>\[ i_+ \approx 0 \]</p>


<p>\[ i_- \approx 0 \]</p>


<p>\[ v_+ \approx v_- \]</p>


<p>When combined, these constraints give rise to a new, very easy method of analysis for these circuits, as we’ll see in the
following sections.</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-113"> Op amps as buffers</span><a id="autopage-113"></a></p>


<p>Let’s see what happens if we take the noninverting amplifier in the section above, and instead of coupling \(v_o\) to
\(v_-\) through a voltage divider, we simply connect them with a wire.<br />
Since this connection provides negative feedback, we can analyze it extremely easily using the virtual short method outlined
above.<br />

<p>First, we note that \(v_+ = v_I\). Via the virtual short, this means that \(v_- \approx v_I\). Since \(v_o = v_-\)
via the wire they share, we draw the conclusion that \(v_o \approx v_I\). Well, that was quick!<br />
</p>


<p>This circuit is known as a buffer, or source follower. It presents a very large (ideally infinite) impedance towards the
input \(v_I\), so that only a very small current is drawn. However, the op amp’s output can deliver an ideally infinite
current (which is very far from true in practice, as signal op amps, as opposed to power op amps, are often limited to less
than 50 or so milliamps).<br />
However, even if the op amp were to be limited to a 10 mA output current, the buffer could still be useful, as many voltage
sources such as sensitive sensors may be unable to provide even 1 mA without negative effects. Thus, even a trivial task
such as connecting the sensor to some reader, perhaps an ADC (analog-to-digital converter) in a microcontroller, may not
work without buffering the voltage first.<br />
</p>


<p>We can also build inverting buffers; see the next section.</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-116"> Inverting amplifier</span><a id="autopage-116"></a></p>


<p>Another amplifier topology that uses negative feedback is the <em>inverting</em> amplifier, which causes e.g. a 1 volt
signal to become \(-1 \cdot G\) at the output, where \(G\) is the circuit’s gain, set by \(R_1\) and \(R_2\).</p>

<p><br />
Since this circuit also uses negative feedback, we can use the virtual short method to analyze it quickly.<br />
First, we note that \(v_+\) is tied to ground, i.e. 0 volts. Therefore, by the virtual short constraint, \(v_-\) will be
approximately 0 volts. Since by our definitions no current flows into the inverting input (\(i_- = 0\)), and we take \(v_- =
0\), the current \(i\) through \(R_2\) must be simply \(\displaystyle \frac {v_I - 0}{R_2}\). Since, again, no current
flows into the inverting input, the same current \(i\) must flow through \(R_1\) as they are then in series.<br />
Therefore, the voltage drop across \(R_1\) is that current times the resistance, or</p>


<p>\[ v_{R1} = \frac {v_I}{R_2} \cdot R_1 \]</p>


<p>The current flows left to right (because of \(v_I\) being the driver towards the inverting input at 0 volts), which means
the <em>positive</em> side of the drop is to the left of \(R_1\) (see the above circuit). Therefore, the node \(v_o\) is equal
to the voltage at \(v_-\) minus that resistor drop:</p>


<p>\[ v_o = 0 - \frac {v_I}{R_2} \cdot R_1 = -v_I \cdot \frac {R_1}{R_2} \]</p>


<p>That concludes our analysis! The circuit is indeed inverting, and the (negative) gain is simply \(\displaystyle \frac
{R_1}{R_2}\).</p>


<p>For the record, the full expression that governs the behavior of this circuit, without the simplifications, is</p>


<p>\[ v_o = -\frac {A v_I R_1}{R_1 + R_2 + A R_2} \]</p>


<p>... from an analysis that was performed, but was not outlined in these notes.<br />
As \(A \to \infty \), the \(R_1 + R_2\) term in the denominator becomes irrelevant, and expression reduces down to one
where we can cancel out the As:</p>


<p>\[ v_o \approx -\frac {\cancel {A} v_I R_1}{\cancel {A} R_2} = -v_I \cdot \frac {R_1}{R_2} \]</p>


<p><br />
Note that if \(R_1 = R_2\), this circuit simply inverts the input, and is therefore an <em>inverting buffer</em>, or
<em>unity gain inverting amplifier</em>, which can certainly be useful.<br />
</p>


<p>The input impedance of this circuit, that is, \(\displaystyle \frac {v_I}{i_I}\), where \(i_I\) is the current flowing
from the input voltage source, is</p>


<p>\[ R_i = \frac {R_1}{A + 1} + R_2 \]</p>


<p>Thus, as \(A \to \infty \) (or just becomes “very large”), the first term is generally irrelevant, and we can say that
\(R_i \approx R_2\).</p>

</figure>

<p><br />
As with the rest of the op amp circuits we’ve analyzed, this one uses negative feedback (see \(R_2\)), so we will again use
the virtual short method to analyze it. However, this analysis is slightly more complex than the previous ones, due to more
algebra at the end.<br />
Anyway, let’s get started.<br />
</p>


<p>Since the noninverting (\(+\)) input doesn’t draw any current, the voltage at \(v_+\) is given by the voltage divider
formed by the \(v_1\) - \(R_1\) - \(R_2\) series circuit:</p>


<p>\[ v_+ = v_1 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]</p>


<p>By the virtual short method, \(v_- = v_+\):</p>


<p>\[ v_- = v_+ \]</p>


<p>Therefore, since we know \(v_-\) and \(v_2\), we can calculate the current through \(R_1\), which we’ll simply call
\(i\):</p>


<p>\[ i = \frac {v_2 - v_-}{R_1} \]</p>


<p>Note that, since the inverting (\(-\)) input draws no current, all of this current must flow through \(R_2\) as well (see
the circuit diagram). Therefore, the we can easily calculate the voltage drop across \(R_2\) as current times resistance,
or</p>


<p>\[ v_{R2} = \frac {v_2 - v_-}{R_1} \cdot R_2 \]</p>


<p>By know, we know \(v_-\), and we know the voltage drop across \(R_2\). Since that voltage drop is positive “towards
the left”, \(v_o\) will be \(v_-\) <em>minus</em> the drop across \(R_2\):</p>


<p>\[ v_o = v_- - v_{R2} \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = v_- - \frac {v_2 - v_-}{R_1} \cdot R_2 \]</p>


<p>Let’s gather the \(v_-\) terms together:</p>


<p>\[ v_o = v_-(1 + \frac {R_2}{R_1}) - \frac {v_2}{R_1} \cdot R_2 \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = v_-(1 + \frac {R_2}{R_1}) - v_2 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1} \]</p>


<p>Let’s substitute in \(v_-\); remember, it’s equal to the expression we have for \(v_+\):</p>


<p>\[ v_o = (v_1 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2}) (1 + \frac {R_2}{R_1}) - v_2 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1} \]</p>


<p>What a mess. Let’s rewrite \(\displaystyle 1 + \frac {R_2}{R_1}\):</p>


<p>\[ v_o = (v_1 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2}) (\frac {R_1 + R_2}{R_1}) - v_2 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1} \]</p>


<p>Aha! Now we can cancel out those \(R_1 + R_2\) terms:</p>


<p>\[ v_o = v_1 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1} - v_2 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1} \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = \frac {R_2}{R_1} \left (v_1 - v_2 \right ) \]</p>


<p>As promised in the section title, this is an op amp <em>subtractor</em> circuit. It calculates \(v_1 - v_2\), scaled by
the ratio of \(R_2\) to \(R_1\).</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-122"> Summing amplifier</span><a id="autopage-122"></a> Since the previous

</figcaption>

</figure>

<p><br />
Yet again, this circuit uses negative feedback, so we can use the virtual short method.<br />
First, we can figure out \(v_+\). Since no current passes through the noninverting (\(+\)) input, we can find \(v_+\) by
analysing the \(v_1\) - \(R_I\) - \(R_I\) - \(v_2\) subcircuit.<br />
Since it’s linear, we can use superposition, and figure out the voltage due to \(v_1\) acting alone (\(v_{+1}\)) and
\(v_2\) acting alone (\(v_{+2}\)). To use superposition, we “set one source to zero” at a time, which for voltage sources
means shorting it out. For \(v_1\):</p>


<p>\[ v_{+1} = v_1 \cdot \frac {R_I}{R_I + R_I} = \frac {v_1}{2} \]</p>


<p>(since the resistors have the same value.)<br />
</p>


<p>Similarly, for \(v_2\):</p>


<p>\[ v_{+2} = v_2 \cdot \frac {R_I}{R_I + R_I} = \frac {v_2}{2} \]</p>


<p>So, the sum of the responses will be \(v_+\):</p>


<p>\[ v_+ = \frac {v_1 + v_2}{2} \]</p>


<p>By the way, note that if the resistors had unequal values, the above would change. Not only would they not be divided
by exactly two, but we would get a <em>weighted average</em>, since the top resistor in this schematic is in the numerator
for the \(v_2\) divider, while the bottom resistor is in the numerator for \(v_1\).<br />
If we relabel the top resistor \(R_1\) and the bottom resistor \(R_2\), and set \(R_1 = 1000\), \(R_2 = 3000\):</p>


<p>\[ v_+ = v_1 \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2} + v_2 \cdot \frac {R_1}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac {3 v_1}{4} + \frac
{v_2}{4} \]</p>


<p><br />
After that aside, let’s get back on track. We found \(v_+\), and via the virtual short method, \(v_- = v_+\).<br />
</p>


<p>There are several ways to find \(v_o\) from here, but the node method gives a solution with only minor algebra. We set
up a node equation for \(v_-\):</p>


<p>\[ \frac {v_-}{R_S} + \frac {v_- - v_o}{R_F} = 0 \]</p>


<p>Move \(v_o\) to the right-hand side and multiply both sides by \(R_F\):</p>


<p>\[ \frac {R_F v_-}{R_S} + v_- = v_o \]</p>


<p>Switch the sides for clarity and factor out \(v_-\):</p>


<p>\[ v_o = \frac {R_F v_-}{R_S} + v_- \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = v_-(\frac {R_F}{R_S} + 1) \]</p>


<p>And, finally, get the actual value of \(v_-\) in there:</p>


<p>\[ v_o = \frac {v_1 + v_2}{2} (\frac {R_F}{R_S} + 1) \]</p>


<p>We’re done! We can also easily see that if we set \(R_F = R_S\), the output is simply \(v_o = v_1 + v_2\).</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-125"> Op amp integrator</span><a id="autopage-125"></a> Due to some magic of
capacitors, we can use op amps to create circuits that integrate and differentiate signals (with respect to time). Here’s an
integrator circuit:</p>

<figcaption>
<p>Figure 5.10:&nbsp;Op amp integrator</p>



</figcaption>

</figure>

<p><br />
How does this circuit work? Well, remember the formula for the voltage over a capacitor:</p>


<p>\[ v_C = \frac {1}{C} \int _{-\infty }^{t} i(t) dt \]</p>


<p>\(v_+\) is grounded, and thus at 0 volts. \(v_-\) is, via the virtual short technique, also 0 volts. Therefore, the
current through \(R\) is simply \(\displaystyle \frac {v_I}{R}\).<br />
That same current must go through the capacitor, since there’s no other way (the noninverting input has an infinite
impedance), so the capacitor voltage drop is</p>


<p>\[ v_C = \frac {1}{C} \int _{-\infty }^{t} \frac {v_I}{R} dt = \frac {1}{RC} \int _{-\infty }^{t} v_I dt \]</p>


<p>As with the previous op amp circuits where the noninverting input is grounded, we can find \(v_o\) as</p>


<p>\[ v_o = v_- - v_C = 0 - \frac {1}{RC} \int _{-\infty }^{t} v_I dt \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = -\frac {1}{RC} \int _{-\infty }^{t} v_I dt \]</p>


<p>Thus this is an inverting integrator. If needed, we could feed the output into an inverting buffer (aka inverting
unity-gain amplifier) to get it positive.<br />
</p>


<p>If we do a more complete analysis, we get the differential equation </p>


<p>\[ RC(1 + A) \frac {dv_-}{dt} + v_- = v_I \]</p>


<p>indicating that the time constant for this circuit is multiplied by the op amp gain \(A\). Therefore, the equation that
describes \(v_o\) for a step input is of the same form as we’ve seen in regular series RC circuits: </p>


<p>\[ v_o = -AV(1 - e^{-\frac {t}{(1 + A)RC}}) \]</p>


<p>... where V is the voltage of the step input.<br />
Thus, for short time scales (short compared to \((1 + A)RC\)), this circuit is a very good approximation of an ideal
integrator.</p>

This circuit is identical to the integrator except for <em>one</em> change: the capacitor and resistor places have been
swapped. So, how does this work, then?<br />
</p>


<p>\(v_+\) is grounded, and so via the virtual short method, \(v_-\) must also be 0 volts. Therefore, the voltage drop
across the capacitor equals \(v_I\). The current through the capacitor is given by</p>


<p>\[ i = C \frac {dv_I}{dt} \]</p>


<p>That same current \(i\) is then forced through the resistor \(R\), which causes a voltage drop of \(R \cdot i\) across
the resistor:</p>


<p>\[ v_R = RC \frac {dv_I}{dt} \]</p>


<p>And, as with several of the previous circuits, \(v_o\) equals \(v_-\) minus the drop across the resistor:</p>


<p>\[ v_o = v_- - v_R = 0 - RC \frac {dv_I}{dt} \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = - RC \frac {dv_I}{dt} \]</p>


<p>So, as with the previous circuit, this one also inverts. And, again, we could pass it through an inverting buffer op amp
to get rid of the inversion.</p>

<p><br />
If we analyze this circuit, we’ll soon find that the transfer function is not at all the one we would expect from just \(R\)
and \(C\). Rather, the transfer function would be</p>


<p>\[ H(s) = \frac {\frac {1}{sC} || R_L}{(\frac {1}{sC} || R_L) + R_{TH} + R} \]</p>


<p>Instead of what we actually wanted:</p>


<p>\[ H(s) = \frac {\frac {1}{sC}}{\frac {1}{sC} + R} \]</p>


<p>What can we do about this? Well, one solution - that works just fine, but is rather wasteful - is to buffer both the input
and output of the filter:<br />

That’s a fair bit of extra complexity! However, the input op amp will make sure that virtually 0 current is drawn from the
source, and decouple the input from the filter.<br />
Likewise, the output op amp will make sure virtually no current is drawn from the RC network, so that the load resistance
doesn’t affect the transfer function.<br />
Assuming ideal op amps, this filter should behave as a passive filter does when there is no load (infinite load resistance) and
0 source resistance. This filter also has (with ideal op amps) infinite input impedance and 0 output impedance!</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-138"> Op amp current source</span><a id="autopage-138"></a></p>


<p>We can use op amps to make very precise current sources. Here’s one of several ways to do so:<br />

</figure>

<p><br />
</p>


<p>Note that the topology above is identical to the noninverting amplifier! I only changed the resistor and voltage source
names, to make things more clear.<br />
How does this circuit work? Well, we have negative feedback, as usual. Therefore, we can apply the virtual short method,
and see that the voltage across \(R_{SET}\) is \(v_{SET}\). Therefore, the current through it is \(\displaystyle \frac
{v_{SET}}{R_{SET}}\).<br />
Since the current into the noninverting input is negligible (even taken as 0 for our model), \(R_L\) and \(R_{SET}\) are
in series, and must share the same current! Therefore, the current through \(R_L\) is the same as the current through
\(R_{SET}\), which the op amp tries to keep equal to \(\displaystyle \frac {v_{SET}}{R_{SET}}\) at all times.<br />
</p>


<p>Of course, there are some limitations. Most op amps have very low current limits, so this will only work for small
currents (a few mA, almost certainly less than 40 or so) or when using power op amps rated for high currents. Second, the
current can clearly never be larger than the supply voltage divided by \(R_{SET} + R_L\), since the supply voltage is
the maximum the op amp can have on its output - in theory, in practice the actual maximum output voltage will always be
slightly lower than the supply voltage.</p>

<p>The inverting amplifier topology is extremely versatile, as we’ve already seen with the integrator and differentiator

<p><br />
The analysis is very similar to that of the inverting amplifier and the integrator/differentiator.<br />
</p>


<p>\(v_+\) is grounded, so \(v_- \approx 0\) by the virtual short method (since we have negative feedback). Therefore,
the voltage across the diode is simply \(v_I\). The current through a diode is given by the Shockley diode equation:</p>


<p>\[ i_D = I_S(e^{v_D/V_T} - 1) \]</p>


<p>\(I_S\) and \(V_T\) are diode parameters. \(I_S\) is the “reverse bias saturation current”, usually a very small value
on the order of \(10^{-14}\) A, while \(V_T\) is the thermal voltage, roughly 25 mV at room temperature.<br />
Now, given that we know the diode voltage drop, we can calculate that the current through it is:</p>


<p>\[ i = I_S(e^{v_I/V_T} - 1) \]</p>


<p>That same current will, as with the previous configurations, be forced to flow through \(R_1\) and create a voltage
drop across it.<br />
\(v_o\) can be seen to be \(v_-\) minus the drop across \(R_1\), and since \(v_-\) is 0: </p>


<p>\[ v_o = -i \cdot R_1 = -R_1 I_S(e^{v_I/V_T} - 1) \]</p>


<p>The above equation makes it clear that there’s an exponential relationship between \(v_I\) and \(v_o\). For a typical
silicon diode at room temperature, with \(R_1 = 1000 \Omega \), we can estimate(!) the relationship as</p>


<p>\[ v_o = -10^{-11} \cdot e^{v_I/0.025} \]</p>


<p>Note that the last “1” was dropped, as its value was \(10^{-11}\) A, a current which is insignificantly small to us.<br />
Though the \(10^{-11}\) term looks like it might dominate, it does not; the exponential increases extremely fast, and the
output voltage goes below \(-100 V\) (remember that it’s an inverting amplifier) when the input is still as low as 0.75 volts.
Of course, the op amp will saturate if the power supply voltage doesn’t reach that low.</p>

<p><br />
This is still easy to analyze, but there’s a bit more math. We still use the diode equation, but this time, we need to solve
the equation for \(v_D\) before we can use it to calculate a voltage drop given a current (the form we have only calculates
current from a known voltage).<br />
</p>


<p>Again, the Shockley diode equation is</p>


<p>\[ i_D = I_S(e^{v_D/V_T} - 1) \]</p>


<p>The current \(i_D\) through the diode will be given by the current through \(R_1\), which is \(\displaystyle \frac
{v_I - v_-}{R_1}\). As \(v_-\) is 0 via the virtual short (this should be second nature at this point!), the current is
simply given by \(\displaystyle \frac {v_I}{R}\), so let’s make that substitution. Then, we will need to solve the equation
for \(v_D\). Let’s start by distributing the \(I_S\), and getting the exponential on its own:</p>


<p>\[ \frac {v_I}{R} = I_S(e^{v_D/V_T} - 1) \]</p>


<p>\[ \frac {v_I}{R} = I_S \cdot e^{v_D/V_T} - I_S \]</p>


<p>\[ \frac {v_I}{R} + I_S = I_S \cdot e^{v_D/V_T} \]</p>


<p>Divide both sides by \(I_S\):</p>


<p>\[ \frac {v_I}{R I_S} + 1 = e^{v_D/V_T} \]</p>


<p>Take the natural log of both sides:</p>


<p>\[ \ln {(\frac {v_I}{R I_S} + 1)} = \frac {v_D}{V_T} \]</p>


<p>And, finally, multiply both sides by \(V_T\), and just switch the sides:</p>


<p>\[ v_D = V_T \cdot \ln {(\frac {v_I}{R I_S} + 1)} \]</p>


<p>Now we know how to calculate the diode’s voltage drop, which makes us very close to finding \(v_o\). We know that
\(v_o = v_- - v_D\), and that \(v_-\) is 0, so</p>


<p>\[ v_o = -v_D \]</p>


<p>\[ v_o = -V_T \cdot \ln {(\frac {v_I}{R I_S} + 1)} \]</p>


<p>And we are done! This is indeed a logarithmic amplifier.</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-147"> Active RC filters</span><a id="autopage-147"></a> We can also construct
filters that use op amps as part of the actual circuitry, rather than just having them as input/output buffer. Such filters are

<p><br />
Let’s get started. We know that \(V_o = A(v_+ - v_-) = -A v_-\).<br />
Let’s write node equations for \(v_1\) and \(v_-\) using the impedance method:</p>


<p>\[ \frac {v_1 - V_i}{R_1} + \frac {v_1 - V_o}{Z_{C2}} + \frac {v_1}{Z_{C1}} = 0 \]</p>


<p>(since \(v_- \approx 0\) via the virtual short technique.) and</p>


<p>\[ \frac {- v_1}{Z_{C1}} + \frac {- V_o}{R2} = 0 \]</p>


<p>(Again, since \(v_- \approx 0\) that term disappears, to simplify our calculations.)</p>


<p>After substituting \(\displaystyle Z_{C1} = \frac {1}{s C_1}\) and \(\displaystyle Z_{C2} = \frac {1}{s C_2}\), we
solve the equations for \(V_o\) (I used Mathematica), simplify and get</p>


<p>\[ V_o = - \frac {s C_1 R_2 V_i}{s^2 + \frac {C_1 + C_2}{C_1 C_2 R_2} s + \frac {1}{C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2}}
\]</p>


<p>Comparing the denominator to the canonical form \(s^2 + 2\alpha s + {\omega _0}^2\) we get</p>


<p>\[ 2\alpha = \Delta \omega = \frac {C_1 + C_2}{C_1 C_2 R_2} \]</p>


<p>\[ \omega _0 = \frac {1}{\sqrt {C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2}} \]</p>


<p>\[ Q = \frac {\omega _0}{2\alpha } = \frac {\sqrt {C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2}}{R_1 C_1 + R_1 C_2} \]</p>


<p>If we substitute \(s = j\omega \) and divide by \(V_i\), we get the circuit’s transfer function \(H(j\omega )\), also
simply \(\displaystyle \frac {V_o}{V_i}\):</p>

<p>Figure 5.18:&nbsp;Positive feedback</p>



</figcaption>

</figure>

<p><br />
</p>


<p>Let’s analyze this circuit intuitively first. Note that we’re feeding a portion of the output back to the <em>positive</em>
terminal of the op amp, which means we now have <em>positive</em> feedback.<br />
Assume that the circuit is in equilibrium, to begin with. What would happen in this circuit if, for whatever reason (noise,
external excitation, etc.) the output node \(v_o\) would increase in voltage?<br />
Well, we have a voltage divider back to the positive terminal, so a portion of that voltage increase would appear at the
positive terminal. Via the op amp equation \(v_o = A(v_+ - v_-)\), the op amp would hugely amplify that voltage, and
vastly increase the output. That, in turn, would make an even higher voltage appear at the + terminal, which would get
amplified, etc. Very quickly, the op amp will spiral out of control, saturate and hit the positive supply rail.<br />
</p>


<p>Let’s then think about what would happen if we start out at \(v_+ = v_- = v_o = 0\) volts. Say \(v_o\) drops down
to \(-1\) volt. A portion of that would be fed back to the positive input; for this example, let’s say \(R_1 = R_2\), so
that exactly half gets fed back.<br />
\(-0.5\) volts would appear at \(v_+\), while \(v_-\) would remain at 0 volts as always (it’s grounded!). Via the good old
op amp equation, we have \(v_o = A(-0.5 - 0)\), so the op amp will try to force the output down as low as it can (as the
value of A is very, very large, the op amp wants \(v_o\) to be much less than the supply voltage that might be on the
order of \(-12\) volts).<br />
</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-153"> Op amp comparator</span><a id="autopage-153"></a></p>


<p>Let’s try to build a circuit that exploits the positive feedback phenomenon, where the output voltage is virtually always
either \(+V_S\) or \(-V_S\). We can use such a circuit as a comparator:<br />

<p>Figure 5.19:&nbsp;Op amp comparator</p>

<p><br />
</p>


<p>This circuit will have \(v_o = V_S\) whenever \(v_I\) is positive (\(v_I &gt; v_-\), and \(v_-\) is grounded) and
\(v_o = -V_S\) when \(v_I\) is negative (\(v_I &lt; v_-\)), as long as \(A v_+ &gt; V_S\) or \(A v_+ &lt; -V_S\) is
true, so that the op amp is saturated.<br />
Of course, the \(v_-\) terminal doesn’t have to be grounded - it could be set to some reference voltage that we want to
compare to \(v_+\), via a voltage divider, perhaps. It could even be a second signal.</p>


<p>Here’s the transfer function for a comparator, normalized so that \(v_o\) ranges between 1 and -1:</p>


<p>(The filled areas are the output; the unconnected lines were hard to spot without the filling.)<br />
Looks great! However, what whould happen if there were noise on the input voltage? The distorted input could cross zero
multiple times due to noise, so the output is not a clean square wave:</p>


<p>Because the noise causes the input to cross zero multiple times extra per cycle, there are glitches in the square wave
output. This example is obviously exaggerated, but we still want a better solution. If we could move the threshold from 0 to
some positive/negative voltage pair, so that the noise doesn’t cross those thresholds very easily, this could be avoided.<br />
Let’s see (in the next section) what would happen to this transfer function if we add positive feedback.</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-156"> Schmitt trigger</span><a id="autopage-156"></a></p>


<p>If we change the circuit slightly from the previous comparator to add positive feedback, and at the same time provide
the input to the inverting input, we get this circuit:<br />

<p>Figure 5.20:&nbsp;Schmitt trigger</p>



</figcaption>

</figure>

<p><br />
</p>


<p>This circuit is a <em>Schmitt trigger</em>; more specifically, an inverting Schmitt trigger. It has <em>hysteresis</em> (it
”remembers” the previous state of the circuit), and will solve the problem we had. How? Well let’s analyze the circuit and
find out!<br />
</p>


<p>Let’s do a manual “simulation” again, like we did with the previous comparator. Also, let’s use some numerical values to
make it a bit more intuitive. We’ll use \(R_1 = R_2\) (their values don’t really matter, only the ratio) and \(V_S\) = 15
V (and therefore \(-V_S = -15\) V). Also, we’ll start off our simulation with \(v_I = 0\) V and \(v_o = 15\) V, a state
that we’ll soon see is valid for the normal operation of this circuit.<br />
</p>


<p>With the values we’ve chosen, \(v_+\) will be half of \(v_o\), so \(v_+ = 7.5\) volts. The op amp equation always
applies, so with \(v_- = v_I = 0\) volts, the op amp will saturate the output, as \(v_o = A(7.5 - v_I) = A(7.5 - 0)\) far
exceeds \(V_S = 15\) volts. Let’s look at that equation a bit more carefully. As long as \(A\) is very big (again, it’s
usually over \(10^4\), and not rarely over \(10^6\)), \(v_o\) will stick to \(V_S\) as long as the input is less than 7.5
volts. For example, say the input increases all the way to 7.4 volts; via \(v_o = A(7.5 - 7.4)\), the output will still be
\(v_o = 0.1 \cdot A\) which still far exceeds \(V_S\).<br />
Interesting things happen when \(v_- &gt; v_+\), however. For example, when \(v_I = v_- = 7.6\) volts, \(v_+ - v_-\)
becomes negative, and the op amp equation evaluates to a hugely negative number, and so the op amp will saturate at the
<em>negative</em> rail \(-V_S\), since \(v_o = A(7.5 - 7.6) = -0.1 \cdot A \ll -V_S\).<br />
</p>


<p>Now that the input has gone above the old “switching threshold” of 7.5 volts, let’s see what happens when we go back
below again. Note that now that \(v_o = -15\) volts, \(v_+ = -7.5\) volts, thanks to the voltage divider at the
output.</p>


<p>We have \(v_o = A(v_+ - v_-) = A(-7.5 - 7.6)\) at the moment, which evaluates to a very negative number, so the op
amp should indeed be in negative saturation. What happens if we lower the input voltage to 7.4 volts, below the old
switching threshold? It still evaluates to a negative number! Even if we go to \(v_I = 0\), it will <em>still</em> evaluate to
\(v_o = A(-7.5)\). In order to get the output to switch, we need to go all the way down to \(v_I \approx -7.5\) volts
(ever-so-slightly lower). Let’s use \(v_I = -7.6\) volts. Via the good old op amp equation, we have \(v_o = A(-7.5 - (-7.6))
= A(0.1)\), which means the output will now switch to positive saturation again, and \(v_+\) will therefore become
\(+7.5\) volts.<br />
</p>


<p>Note that now that we’ve switched again, the only way to switch the output back to the negative voltage is to go above
\(v_I = 7.5\) volts, at which point \(v_O = A(7.5 - v_I)\) will turn negative.<br />
</p>


<p>So, as can be seen in the rather messy analysis above, a signal like our sine wave will cause a clean square wave output,
as the noise we had comes nowhere near \(V_S/2\) or \(-V_S/2\), and so the output won’t switch more than once per
intentional zero crossing. This trigger’s inverting nature is also clear, as it only switches to a negative output when the
input gets <em>positive</em> enough.<br />
</p>


<p>Let’s go back to the noisy sine wave, and see how the same input looks through a Schmitt trigger, instead of a
comparator:</p>


<p>(Again, the filled areas are the output.)<br />
As in the textual example above, we start out with the input at \(0\) volts (plus a whole ton of noise, which makes it start
out closer to 5 than 0), and start the world with \(v_o = 15\) V, and take it from there.<br />
Despite the extreme, exaggerated noise, the output is a perfectly clean square wave! Note how the output switches
whenever the input crosses the \(\pm 7.5\) V threshold set by the voltage divider, but only from “one direction” - for
example, when the sine wave is starting to go up from its bottom position around the graph’s middle, it crosses the -7.5
volt threshold without anything happening. In just this graph, the sine wave crosses the thresholds 6 times (6 intended
times - not counting the extra ones due to the noise), but only switches 3 times. This is due to hysteresis - the past
matters; which “direction” it comes from decides whether the output will switch or not.<br />
Also, of course, note how the output is an inversion of the input. It is however perfectly possible to build non-inverting
Schmitt triggers.<br />
</p>


<p>We can also vary the switching thresholds. The equation is</p>


<p>\[ V_{thres} = \pm v_I \cdot \frac {R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]</p>


<p>... where \(R_2\) is the resistor between \(v_+\) and ground.</p>
<p><span class="paragraph" id="autosec-159"> Relaxation oscillator</span><a id="autopage-159"></a> We can use the
inverting Schmitt trigger to make an op amp oscillator, by allowing a capacitor to control the \(v_-\) voltage. The
capacitor is then charged/discharged through a resistor connected to \(v_o\), like this:</p>

</figure>

<p>Notice that the bottom resistors are the same value, so that the thresholds are again set at \(\pm V_S\).<br />
The “top” resistor \(R\) is the only one that matters for the rise/fall times, while the “bottom” ones are the only ones that
matter for setting the switching thresholds.<br />
</p>


<p>Let’s take the usual intuitive look at how this would work. Imagine it starts out with the capacitor voltage (which is the
same as \(v_-\)) at 0 volts, and \(v_o\) at the positive rail, 15 volts (so -\(V_S\) is then -15 volts).<br />
In this state, a current will flow from \(v_o\) to \(v_-\), due to the voltage difference (15 - 0 volts). This current flows
through \(R_1\), and has nowhere to go but through the capacitor, so the capacitor is charged by this current. It keeps
charging along happily with no other change in the circuit, up until it passes just slightly above 7.5 volts (\(V_S/2\)). At
that point, according to the op amp equation, \(v_o = A(7.5 - v_-)\) will turn negative, and force \(v_o\) down to the
negative rail.<br />
When that happens, the capacitor voltage will be almost exactly \(7.5\) volts, while \(v_o\) will be at \(-15\). Therefore
the capacitor will discharge through \(R\), until it’s down to \(V_S/2 = -7.5\) volts, at which point \(v_o = A(-7.5 -
v_-)\) will turn positive, and force \(v_o\) to the positive rail. This cycle will repeat over and over, and produce - at least
in theory - a perfect square wave, with a 50% duty cycle (i.e. the “on time” is exactly equal to the “off time”).<br />
</p>


<p>Now, let’s turn to calculating the oscillation frequency of this circuit. The way we do this is to calculate the rise time
and the fall time for the RC circuit at the inverting input, and use that information to find the frequency.</p>
<h5 id="autosec-162"> <span class="sectionnumber">5.0.1&#x2001;</span>Rise time</h5><a id="autopage-162"></a>

<p>To calculate the rise time, let us define \(t = 0\) such that the capacitor voltage is as low as it ever gets, i.e.
\(-V_S/2\). We can then use our old trusty formula \(v_C = V_S + (V_0 - V_S)e^{-t/RC}\), and set that equal to the
target voltage, \(V_S/2\):</p>

\begin{align*} \frac {V_S}{2} &amp;= V_S + (-\frac {V_S}{2} - V_S) e^{-t_r/RC}\\ \frac {V_S}{2} &amp;= V_S
- \frac {3V_S}{2} e^{-t_r/RC} \end{align*}
</p>


<p>To start with, we subtract \(V_S\) from both sides, and then multiply by \(-1\):</p>


<p>\[ -\frac {V_S}{2} = - \frac {3V_S}{2} e^{-t_r/RC} \]</p>


<p>\[ \frac {V_S}{2} = \frac {3V_S}{2} e^{-t_r/RC} \]</p>


<p>We can now divide both sides by \(\displaystyle \frac {3 V_S}{2}\), which is the same as multiplying by
\(\displaystyle \frac {2}{3 V_S}\):</p>


<p>\[ \frac {V_S}{2} \cdot \frac {2}{3 V_S} = \frac {2}{3 V_S} \cdot \frac {3V_S}{2} e^{-t_r/RC} \]</p>


<p>\[ \frac {\cancel {V_S}}{\cancel {2}} \cdot \frac {\cancel {2}}{3 \cancel {V_S}} = e^{-t_r/RC} \]</p>


<p>This remains:</p>


<p>\[ \frac {1}{3} = e^{-t_r/RC} \]</p>


<p>We take the natural log of both sides, and multiply both sides by -RC:</p>


<p>\[ \ln {\left (\frac {1}{3}\right )} = -\frac {t_r}{RC} \]</p>


<p>\[ -RC \ln {\left (\frac {1}{3}\right )} = t_r \]</p>


<p>Via log rules, \(\ln {(1/3)} = \ln {(1)} - \ln {(3)} = 0 - \ln {(3)}\):</p>


<p>\[ t_r = RC \ln {(3)} \]</p>


<p>Ah, finally: we know the rise time. Next up: fall time.</p>
<h5 id="autosec-163"> <span class="sectionnumber">5.0.2&#x2001;</span>Fall time</h5><a id="autopage-163"></a>

<p>For the fall time, we use the same equation \(v_C = V_S + (V_0 - V_S)e^{-t/RC}\), but plug in other values for the
variables, and then set it equal to the target value of \(-V_S/2\). Remember that the “supply” that is “charging” the
capacitor is now \(-V_S\), and the initial voltage now \(V_S/2\):</p>


<p>\[ -\frac {V_S}{2} = -V_S + (\frac {V_S}{2} - (-V_S))e^{-t_f/RC} \]</p>


<p>\[ -\frac {V_S}{2} = -V_S + \frac {3 V_S}{2} e^{-t_f/RC} \]</p>


<p>Compare this form to the rise time:</p>


<p>\[ \frac {V_S}{2} = V_S - \frac {3V_S}{2} e^{-t_r/RC} \]</p>


<p>If we multiply both sides of the fall time equation by \(-1\), we can easily see that these equations are exactly the same,
which means the answer must also be the same!</p>


<p>\[ t_f = t_r = RC \ln {(3)} \]</p>
<h5 id="autosec-164"> <span class="sectionnumber">5.0.3&#x2001;</span>Frequency</h5><a id="autopage-164"></a>

<p>Frequency is the inverse of cycle time, and \(t_r + t_f\) make up one full cycle. Therefore,</p>


<p>\[ f = \frac {1}{t_r + t_f} = \frac {1}{2 RC \ln {(3)}} \]</p>


<p>If the negative supply is not equal to exactly \(-V_S\), the formula above (and its derivation) becomes quite a bit more
complex. We will not worry about that case, as having equal supplies to within a small margin of error is common.     </p>
